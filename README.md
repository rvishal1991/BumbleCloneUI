# 🐝 Bumble UI Clone in SwiftUI

A SwiftUI-based UI prototype inspired by the Bumble app. This project is a hands-on exploration of gesture handling, overlays, view routing, and dynamic layouts using SwiftUI.

## ✨ Features

- 🔄 Swipeable cards using draggesture with some modification using `SwiftfulUI`
- 🧩 Custom overlays (e.g., "Like", "Nope", etc.)
- 🧭 Navigation using `SwiftfulRouting`
- ♻️ Modular and reusable UI components
- 🎞️ Smooth SwiftUI animations and transitions

## 🧰 Used Third-Party Packages

This project leverages a few third-party libraries to extend SwiftUI capabilities and simplify development:

- [`SDWebImageSwiftUI`](https://github.com/SDWebImage/SDWebImageSwiftUI.git) – For lazy loading image from web
- [`SwiftfulRouting`](https://github.com/SwiftfulThinking/SwiftfulRouting) – For naviagtion  
- [`SwiftfulUI`](https://github.com/SwiftfulThinking/SwiftfulUI.git) – Some useful available resusable components
